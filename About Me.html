Education has always been a priority for me, and I am proud to share my academic achievements. In 2010, I graduated as the Salutatorian from Sinapangan Sur Elementary School, where I laid the foundation for my educational journey. Continuing my pursuit of knowledge, I then graduated as the Salutatorian from Sinapangan National High School in 2014.
Driven by my passion for agriculture, I embarked on a new chapter in my life by enrolling at DMMMSU-NLUC. It was there that I dedicated my time and efforts to studying Crop Science Agronomy. In 2018, I graduated with honors, earning my Bachelor of Science degree in Agriculture, with the distinction of Cum Laude, granting me the honor graduate eligibility.
To further validate my expertise in the field, I successfully passed the 2019 licensure examination for agriculturists. This achievement has opened doors for me to contribute to the agricultural sector, where I can make a positive impact.

In conclusion, I am a dedicated, ambitious, and passionate individual who strives for excellence in all aspects of life.
