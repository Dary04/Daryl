Our roots are deeply embedded in the town of San Mateo, Isabela, where my father hails from. Meanwhile, my mother's origins lie in the beautiful town of Tallipugo, Balaoan, La Union. It is in Tallipugo, Balaoan, La Union, that we have chosen to create our home and build a life filled with love, laughter, and shared experiences.
As a family, we cherish the values of respect, honesty, and kindness. We support and encourage each other to pursue our dreams and aspirations. Together, we embark on various adventures, both within our community and beyond, fostering a spirit of curiosity and a thirst for knowledge.

We are eternally grateful for the blessings that life has bestowed upon us, and we strive to spread positivity and generosity wherever we go. Our family bond is unbreakable, and we stand by each other through thick and thin, embodying loyalty and trust.

In conclusion, the Casiño family is a harmonious unit that thrives on love, ambition, and togetherness. We are grateful for the opportunity to introduce ourselves, and we look forward to creating lasting memories and forging meaningful connections with all those we encounter along our journey.
